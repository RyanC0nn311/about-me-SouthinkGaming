            <h2> Lorem Ipsum Article </h2>

            <div>
                <p>
                    “P.S.--I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my soul.
                    It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter not come into your hands until to-morrow morning.
                    In that case, dear Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the course of the day;
                    and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It may then already be too late; and if that night passes without
                    event, you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility
                    of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to
                    judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility.
                    I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekyll's house. The butler was awaiting my
                    arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a
                    locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman's
                    surgical theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll's private cabinet is most conveniently entered.
                    The door was very strong, the lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much
                    damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after
                    two hour's work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up
                    with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the
                    dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekyll's private manufacture: and when I opened one of the
                    wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my
                    attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and
                    seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess.
                    The book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many
                    years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was
                    appended to a date, usually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six times in a total of several
                    hundred entries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!”
                    All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the
                    record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll's investigations) to no end of practical
                    usefulness. How could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of
                    my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why could he not go to another? And even granting some
                    impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that
                    I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver,
                    that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.

                <p>
                    Twelve o'clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door.
                    I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico.
                </p>

                <p>“Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?” I asked.</p>

                <p>
                    He told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him enter, he did not obey me without a searching
                    backward glance into the darkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing with his bulls eye open;
                    and at the sight, I thought my visitor started and made greater haste.
